# sql-challenge

In this project, I compiled data files into a single database. 

To begin, I created an Entity Relationship Diagram using QuickDBD. I linked up the tables using primary and foreign keys.

Next, I created the database and uploaded the data into 6 corresponding tables. I ran queries on the database to collect information. Some of the queries included Join statements, subqueries, order by and count.
